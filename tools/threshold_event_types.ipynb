Extreme value analysis relies on having enough data to characterize the extremes, which is complicated by the fact that hourly climate data are \"autocorrelated\", meaning that one hour of data is not independent from the previous hour. This inherent autocorrelation of timeseries data reduces the \"effective sample size\" of the data, which is an estimate of how many independent data values we have. \n",

When the sample size is too small, the underlying assumptions for extreme value analysis may no longer be satisfied, which can result in biased estimates of the distributions of extreme values. This is why the code will display a warning if the average ESS in your blocks of data is less than 25. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are only interested in identifying the maximum extreme value in each year of the data and do not plan to fit an extreme value distribution to the maximums, you can proceed with block size of 1 year, and can suppress the warning with the optional `check_ess=False`. \n",
