    "Preview various transforms on the data in real time. The below panel walks through several options for transforming your time series, such as:\n",
    "- Comparing the difference between the variable of interest and a 30-year historical baseline of January 1, 1981 to December 31, 2010. You can also select your own baseline range of interest out to 12/31/2021.\n",
    "- Removing the seasonal cycle (removing the mean monthly signal in each month) to view within-year patterns independent from the impact of seasonality.\n",
    "- Smooth your timeseries to remove noise with a running average, by specifying the number of timesteps to average over (for example you may want to average over 1, 3, 5, or 10 years). This option is only recommended if you want to examine changes in mean conditions.\n",
    "- Choose the disaggregate into four seasons option to examine patterns in a given season (data is grouped into December-January-February, March-April-May, June-July-August, or September-October-November, which can be toggled between in a dropdown menu at the bottom of the panel).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also choose to explore patterns in the minimum, maximum, or an extreme of your choice (defined by the percentile slider: e.g. temperatures above the 90th percentile)\n",
    "- If you choose to look at extremes, you can change the resampling window and period to assess how extreme a pattern is over a time period of your own choosing\n",
    "    - For example, you may want to examine the annual minimum, in which we would recommend selecting “min”, 1 for the window, and “years” for the resample period. \n",
    "    - Likewise, if you were interested in the decadal maximum, you would select “max”, 10 for the window, and “years” for the period\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of climatological interest: \n",
    "- Hourly: Consider 6, 12, or 24 hour events\n",
    "- Daily: Consider 3 day (heat wave length events), 7 day (week long), 14 day (biweekly), or 30 day events\n",
    "- Monthly: Consider sub-annual and seasonal scales, where 3, 6, 12 months could represent seasonal or dry/wet season interest periods\n",
    "- Yearly: Consider 5, 10 year intervals and beyond to assess long-term climatology trends\n",
