    "# Understanding Climate Data on the Analytics Engine\n",
    "This notebook is a walkthrough of how to utilize different kinds of climate data, including weather observations, reanalysis products, and model output available on the Analytics Engine. \n",
    "* Weather observations are inherently point locations, tied to a single station location, and represent the actual values of weather variables. Weather observations are highly localized weather information, and are limited by instrumentation constraints.\n",
    "* Reanalysis products are reconstructions of the historical weather observation period. Limitations...\n",
    "* Climate model output is a representation of a time period, and are intentionally not designed to recreate the trends seen in weather observations, but capture one possible realization of those trends. The variability in individual climate model realizations is how we are able to determine the range of potential future realities.  \n",
