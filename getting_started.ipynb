    "\n",
    "Along with settings regarding your climate variable, data resolution, location settings, and many other options, there are several high-level options you'll need to set when selecting your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Select your data type\n",
    "#### Gridded\n",
    "Gridded (i.e. raster) climate data at various spatial resolutions.\n",
    "#### Stations\n",
    "Gridded (i.e. raster) climate data at unique grid cell(s) corresponding to the central coordinates of the selected weather station(s). \n",
    "- This data is bias-corrected (i.e localized) to the exact location of the weather station using the historical in-situ data from the weather station(s). \n",
    "- This data is currently only available for dynamically downscaled air temperature data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Select your scientific approach \n",
    "#### Time\n",
    "Retrieve the data using a traditional time-based approach that allows you to select historical data, future projections, or both, along with a time-slice of interest. \n",
    "- “Historical Climate” includes data from 1980-2014 simulated from the same GCMs used to produce the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). It will be automatically appended to a SSP time series when both are selected. Because this historical data is obtained through simulations, it represents average weather during the historical period and is not meant to capture historical timeseries as they occurred.\n",
    "- “Historical Reconstruction” provides a reference downscaled [reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/focus/2020/fact-sheet-reanalysis) dataset based on atmospheric models fit to satellite and station observations, and as a result will reflect observed historical time-evolution of the weather.\n",
    "- Future projections are available for [greenhouse gas emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, or SSP)](https://climatescenarios.org/primer/socioeconomic-development) SSP 3-7.0 through 2100 with the dynamically-downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs).\n",
    "     - One GCM was additionally downscaled for two additional SSPs (SSP 5-8.5 and SSP 2-4.5)\n",
    "#### Warming Level\n",
    "Retrieve the data by future global warming levels, which will automatically retrieve all available model data for the historical+future period and then calculate the time window around which each simulation reaches the selected warming level.  \n",
    "- Because warming levels are defined based on amount of global mean temperature change, they can be used to compare possible outcomes across multiple scenarios or model simulations.\n",
    "- This approach includes all simulations that reach a specified amount of warming regardless of when they reach that level of warming, rather than the time-based appraoch, which will preliminarily subset a portion of simulations that follow a given SSP trajectory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3) Select your downscaling method\n",
    "#### Dynamical\n",
    "[Dynamically downscaled](https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/alexhall/downscaling-cmip6) WRF data, produced at hourly intervals. If you select 'daily' or 'monthly' for 'Timescale', you will receive an average of the hourly data. The spatial resolution options, on the other hand, are each the output of a different simulation, nesting to higher resolution over smaller areas.\n",
    "#### Statistical \n",
    "[Hybrid-statistically downscaled](https://loca.ucsd.edu) LOCA2-Hybrid data, available at daily and monthly timescales. Multiple LOCA2-Hybrid simulations are available (100+) at a fine spatial resolution of 3km."
