    "- [Dynamically downscaled](https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/alexhall/downscaling-cmip6) WRF data, produced at hourly intervals. If you select 'daily' or 'monthly' for 'Timescale', you will receive an average of the hourly data. The spatial resolution options, on the other hand, are each the output of a different simulation, nesting to higher resolution over smaller areas.\n",
    "    - In addition to the gridded WRF data, you may also be interested in point-based data at a weather station. Station data is bias-corrected, or localized, to the exact location with the dynamically-downscaled gridded data. \n",
    "- [Hybrid-statistically downscaled](https://loca.ucsd.edu) LOCA2-Hybrid data, available at daily and monthly timescales. Multiple LOCA2-Hybrid simulations are available (100+) at a fine spatial resolution of 3km.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also multiple time periods of interest available:\n",
    "<br><br>**Historical**:\n",
    "- “Historical Climate” includes data from 1980-2014 simulated from the same GCMs used to produce the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). It will be automatically appended to a SSP time series when both are selected. Because this historical data is obtained through simulations, it represents average weather during the historical period and is not meant to capture historical timeseries as they occurred.\n",
    "- “Historical Reconstruction” provides a reference downscaled [reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/focus/2020/fact-sheet-reanalysis) dataset based on atmospheric models fit to satellite and station observations, and as a result will reflect observed historical time-evolution of the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future**:\n",
    "- Future projections are available for [greenhouse gas emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, or SSP)](https://climatescenarios.org/primer/socioeconomic-development) SSP 3-7.0 through 2100 with the dynamically-downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs).\n",
    "     - One GCM was additionally downscaled for two additional SSPs (SSP 5-8.5 and SSP 2-4.5) \n",
