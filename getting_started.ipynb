    "Currently, you can select from [dynamically-downscaled](https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/alexhall/downscaling-cmip6) data produced at hourly intervals. If you select 'daily' or 'monthly' for 'Timescale', you will receive an average of the hourly data. The spatial resolution options, on the other hand, are each the output of a different simulation, nesting to higher resolution over smaller areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "“Historical Climate” includes data from 1980-2014 simulated from the same GCMs used to produce the SSPs. They can be appended to a SSP time series using the option “Append historical.” Because this historical data is obtained through simulations, it represents average weather during the historical period and is not meant to capture historical timeseries as they occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Historical Reconstruction” provides a reference downscaled [reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/focus/2020/fact-sheet-reanalysis) dataset based on atmospheric models fit to satellite and station observations, and as a result will reflect observed historical time-evolution of the weather.\n",
