    "# Custom Climate Profiles Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many energy system modeling and other planning processes are designed to intake hourly information in order to capture short term fluctuations in conditions that affect energy supply and demand. An *Annualized Hourly Climate Profile* is a dataset that contains hourly weather conditions at a given location for an entire year, and is commonly referred to as an **8760 Climate Profile**. Climate profiles are able to represent future weather conditions due to a changing climate and can thus better inform design and planning processes for a wide range of future needs. Guidance, methodologies, and recommendations for Cal-Adapt Climate Profiles is [available](https://analytics.cal-adapt.org/analytics/methods/) for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine, we currently provide two kinds of Climate Profiles: \n",
    "1. **Standard Year 8760**:  One year of hourly data that represents any desired statistical percentile of weather conditions for a location over a 30-year climatological period. A Standard Year builds a climate profile for each climate model on a single variable and can be used to evaluate both median and extreme conditions by selecting appropriate percentiles. Both historical and future Standard Year 8760s are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Typical Meteorological Year 8760 (TMY)**: One year of hourly data that represents the median weather conditions for a location over a climatological period. A TMY is built from ten specific weather variables that are weighted in compliance with TMY standards (insert reference to NREL). TMYs statistically assess the median conditions from 30 years of model data and select the most “typical” month for each month during a year. These are then compiled into a single climate profile. The resulting TMY file includes multiple variables and has very specific formatting requirements. Both historical and future TMY (FTMY) 8760s are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intended Application**: As a user, I want to <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">**generate a custom climate profile**</span> for my area:\n",
    "1. Standard Year 8760 profile, with my variable and extreme conditions of choice\n",
    "2. TMY 8760 profile, for the closest weather station to my area. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime**: A Standard Year 8760 can take between **5-60 minutes**, depending on selections to generate. A TMY 8760 profile will take approximately **45 minutes** to generate. Modifications to selections may increase the runtime. "

    "The SY for a given 30-year period (either the historical period 1981-2010, or a thirty year window centered on where each GCM simulation reaches the specified global warming level) is calculated by identifying for each hour the hourly value that is closest to the mean hourly value across all years to produce a full annual timeseries of hourly data for a variable of interest that best represents the average conditions.\n",
