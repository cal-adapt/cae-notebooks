Climate Profiles Notebooks
==========================

This folder will house notebooks that can be used to generate custom Climate Profiles hourly datasets (8760s), including Standard Year Profile (single variable), Typical Meteorological Years (TMY, multivariable), and 8760s.

[custom_climate_profiles.ipynb](custom_climate_profiles.ipynb): Generate a custom hourly climate profile a single location.  *In development*

*For example: How do I generate a TMY in .epw format for the Los Angeles International Airport location using climate model data?*


[typical_meteorological_year_methodology.ipynb](typical_meteorological_year_methodology.ipynb): Explore the full methodology of a Typical Meteorological Year to represent the typical climatological conditions over one year of hourly data.  

*For example: What will an average year of hourly temperature data look like in a 2Â°C warmer world?*
