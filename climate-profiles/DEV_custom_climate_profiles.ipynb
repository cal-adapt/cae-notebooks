    "A climate profile is a representative year of hourly data that is meant to capture the intrannual weather patterns for a location of interest. This time series is constructed by piecing together either historical or synthetic data. Thhis notebook generated two type of climate profiles: the average meteorolical year (AMY) and the typical meteorological year (TMY). AMY is recommended for most applications, while TMY is a strictly defined construct suitable for a narrow range of applications in the utilities sector.\n"
