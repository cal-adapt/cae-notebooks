Work in Progress
================

Notebooks that are actively in development-- proceed with caution! These notebooks are likely to change as we work to improve our workflow and methodology.

[average_meteorological_year.ipynb](average_meteorological_year.ipynb): Explore the concept and applications of an Average Meteorological Year to represent the mean climatological conditions over one year of hourly data.  

*For example: What will an average year of hourly temperature data look like in a 2°C warmer world?*

[threshold_basics.ipynb](threshold_basics.ipynb): Introduction to extreme value analysis. Demonstrates how to compute statistical values of interest related to extreme weather events.  

*For example: What is the return value for a 1 in 20 extreme heat event in Sacramento County at mid-century?*

[typical_meteorological_year_methodology.ipynb](typical_meteorological_year_methodology.ipynb): Explore the concept and methodology of a Typical Meteorological Year to represent the typical climatological conditions over one year of hourly data.  

*For example: What will an average year of hourly temperature data look like in a 2°C warmer world?*

[model_variance.ipynb](model_variance.ipynb): Introduction to calculating model variance across climate models at a location.  

*For example: What is the full range of possible outcomes in air temperature in Alameda County if I can only select a few model simulations?*

[agnostic_tools.ipynb](agnostic_tools.ipynb): Introduction to model agnostic tool development for model selection based on a set of preformulated metrics.  

*For example: What is the projected warming level in the year 2050 based on all available model simulations?*
