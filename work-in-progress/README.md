Work in Progress
================

Notebooks that are actively in development-- proceed with caution! These notebooks are likely to change as we work to improve our workflow and methodology.

[average_meteorological_year.ipynb](average_meteorological_year.ipynb): Explore the concept and applications of an Average Meteorological Year to represent the mean climatological conditions over one year of hourly data.  

*For example: What will an average year of hourly temperature data look like in a 2Â°C warmer world?*

[threshold_basics.ipynb](threshold_basics.ipynb): Introduction to extreme value analysis. Demonstrates how to compute statistical values of interest related to extreme weather events.  

*For example: What is the return value for a 1 in 20 extreme heat event in Sacramento County at mid-century?*

[model_variance.ipynb](model_variance.ipynb): Introduction to calculating model variance across climate models at a location.  

*For example: What is the full range of possible outcomes in air temperature in Alameda County if I can only select a few model simulations?*

[agnostic_tools.ipynb](agnostic_tools.ipynb): Introduction to model agnostic tool development for model selection based on a set of preformulated metrics.  

*For example: What is the projected warming level in the year 2050 based on all available model simulations?*

[climate_state_finder.ipynb](climate_state_finder.ipynb): Tool to pull out climate states for all simulations (LOCA2 & WRF) and any user selected variable.  

*For example: What precipitation climate states will we observe in the future?*

[event_finder.ipynb](event_finder.ipynb): Tool to find all user-defined event in all LOCA2 and WRF simulations for a given GWL.

*For example: When do we observe a 1 in 10 year event under 2.0 GWL?*

[generalized_climate_signal_selector.ipynb](generalized_climate_signal_selector.ipynb): Tool to estimate the climate signal for a given variable for all WRF and LOCA2 simulations.

*For example: Which simulations project a wetting precipitation signal and which project a drying signal?*
