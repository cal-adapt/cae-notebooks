    "# Calculating a Typical Meteorological Year\n",
    "<br>This notebook walks through the process of calculating a [Typical Meteorological Year](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/data-sets/tmy), an hourly dataset used for applications in energy and building systems modeling. Because this represents average rather than extreme conditions, an TMY dataset is not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TMY methodology here mirrors that of the Sandia/NREL TMY3 methodology, and uses historic and projected downscaled climate data available through the Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine catalog. As this methodology heavily weights the solar radiation input data, be aware that the final selection of \"typical\" months may not be typical for other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Intended Application** As a user, I want to <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">**generate a typical meteorological year file**</span> for a location of interest:\n",
    "- Understand the methods that are involved in generating a TMY dataset\n",
    "- Visualize the TMY dataset across all input variables\n",
    "- Export the TMY dataset for available models for input into my workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "1. This notebook is a **full demonstration** of the Typical Meteorological Year methodology, for full transparency. For practical generation of a TMY dataset, a user <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">**only needs to provide 2 elements**</span>: the **location**, and **reference time period**. These selections are highlighted below for you. \n",
    "2. The Analytics Engine at present has an *Average Meteorological Year* functionality. The methods shown throughout this notebook will soon replace the underlying backend `climakitae` code for the AMY in order to better address our user needs, i.e., we are working to replace the AMY with the TMY methods. We provide this walkthrough to demonstrate confidence in the \"AMY to TMY\" conversion process for our users in the meantime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime**: With the default settings, this notebook takes approximately **30 minutes** to run from start to finish. Modifications to selections may increase the runtime."

For data post-2014, we will utilize SSP 3-7.0, although scenario selection in the near-future is relatively independent.
