    "## Background and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we mean by 'uncertainty'\n",
    "There are several kinds of scientific uncertainty that arise when working with long-term projections of future climates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Model Uncertainty</b>, or the differences between different models (namely, how model physics, settings, or parameters can change the outcome).\n",
    "2. <b>Internal Variability</b>, which represents the variations inherent within the climate system itself.\n",
    "3. <b>Scenario Uncertainty</b>, which arises from differences in outcomes between emissions trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores <b>Internal Variability</b> in the Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine by focusing on projected changes in extreme precipitation. We show results across the suite of models currently available in the [Cal-Adapt Data Catalog](https://analytics.cal-adapt.org/data/) as well as the full set of CMIP6 models. We also provide a reasonable strategy for handling data with large internal variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terms used throughout this notebook\n",
    "<b>Ensemble:</b> A set of simulations run using a single model. For the purposes of this analysis, each <i>ensemble member</i> might differ in the following ways:\n",
    "- What point in time of the control data set was used as input data for the ensemble member.\n",
    "- What physics options are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the underlying model structure and emissions scenario remain constant across an ensemble, we call the differences between ensemble members <i>internal variability</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Downscaling:</b> Global climate models are often run with a coarse grid size (on the order of 1 x 1 degrees [100 x 100 km]) which is much larger than the scale of many weather events of interest (on the order of 1-10 km). To capture smaller scale processes, one ensemble member from each Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine model was used to provide input data for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The WRF output provides data at 45 km, 9 km, and 3 km spatial scale for the WECC region. The following table shows the original grid sizes for the downscaled models.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model name    | Longitude spacing (deg) | Latitude spacing (deg) |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| CESM2         |                     1.3 |                    0.9 |\n",
    "| CNRM-ESM2-1   |                     1.4 |                    1.4 |\n",
    "| EC-EARTH3-Veg |                     0.7 |                    0.7 |\n",
    "| FGOALS-g3     |                       2 |                    2.3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Data pooling:</b> In our case, this refers to placing all the model output into a single data \"bucket\" to increase our sample size before computing statistics. This notebook will show why this is an appropriate practice. "

    "Looking at all Cal-Adapt models reveals quite a bit of disagreement in precipitation accumulations, as well as precipitation sign and magnitude changes by end-of-century.

In the next section, we will elucidate how internal variability contributes to these differences."

    "Differences between results obtained via a multi-model mean or multi-model pool are subtle. There are even many points at which the difference is statistically significant in both the mean and pooled results. This might suggest that either method is acceptable. However, extreme events are rare (i.e., they give us a very small sample size), there are large differences between models (Section 1.1), and there is even more substantial internal variability (Section 1.4). In light of this, <b>any statistical significance between the multi-model means can lead to overconfidence in the results</b>. Instead, the available data should be pooled to increase the sample size. "

    "* The uncertainty related to these sources is exacerbated by small sample size.\n",
    "* The 'Difference' results in 1.1 show that cross-model results can be in conflict with one another, with some models showing marked decreases in extreme precipitation where others show large increases. This makes it difficult to use these projections for impacts research and planning and preparedness purposes.\n",
