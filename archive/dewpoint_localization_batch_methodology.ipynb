    "> ⚠️ WARNING:\n",
    "> This notebook is no longer being maintained and is not functional within the existing `climakitae` core functionality. Notebook was a one-time methodology and data generation request. \n",
    "> Notebook retained for archival reference, data access available via recommended methods. Archived Feb 2026. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the full pre-processing and batch mode calculation for localized WRF data at 71 WECC weather station locations for both air temperature (degF) and dew-point temperature (degF). \n",
    "\n",
    "Produces:\n",
    "- A single netcdf file per station with air temperature and dewpoint temperature as separate variables\n",
    "- Summary statistics csv file\n",
    "    - Values represent the multi-model mean count of dewpoint temperature exceeding air temperature per month    \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#FF0000\">**Reference Notebook Only**</span>: The HadISD station data used to localize WRF data are in a private bucket location `wecc-hadisd` that requires access in order to run this notebook. **Therefore this notebook is provided as methodology process only, and cannot be run**. The sole reason for this is that the version of the HadISD station data that is \"hooked up\" to climakitae only has the air temperature variable at present. Replacing the publically available station data with the version with the second variable dew-point temperature would \"break\" the existing climakitae code. Once the climakitae backend code is updated, the version of data with both variables will replace the single-variable version. \n",
