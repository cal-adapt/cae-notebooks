    "This notebook calculates an hourly time series for an average meteorological year (AMY) for a given location, representing the mean weather conditions for a one-year period. This was designed to provide a similar product to a [Typical Meteorological Year](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/data-sets/tmy), an hourly dataset used for applications in energy and building systems modeling. Because this represents average rather than extreme conditions, an AMY dataset is not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine, there are three options for investigating AMY:  \n",
    "1. Absolute AMY: represents the historical reference period (1981-2010) or a future reference period based around a 30-year warming level time window. **Note: Absolute AMY data and display is not bias corrected, and should be used for visual data inspection only.**\n",
    "2. Difference AMY: represents the difference between a designated future 30-year period and the historical baseline (1981-2010)\n",
    "3. Severe meteorological year: represents the difference between the 90th percentile for a designated future 30-year period and the historical baseline (1981-2010)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using app.explore.amy() panel, you can easily set how you want to compute the average meteorological year and view a heatmap of the resulting average meteorological year. We also break down the calculation and illustrate how to manually calculate and output a typical month of choice within an average meteorological year."
