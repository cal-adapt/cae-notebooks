    "Welcome to the [Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine](https://analytics.cal-adapt.org/about/) JupyterHub! Here, you can access tools and guidance to explore and analyze climate projections data downscaled for California.

    "### About Jupyter Notebooks \n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "If you are new to working with Jupyter Notebooks, check out our [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEo9V_OJw9w) or review Jupyter's [introductory documentation](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb). You can also review our [technical documentation](https://climakitae.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more about the open source python library that powers these notebooks, `climakitae`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each link below will open up a Jupyter notebook that will step through: \n",
    "1) Selecting climate data you are interested in\n",
    "2) Transforming the data or conducting an analysis\n",
    "3) Exporting data or visualizations<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access these notebooks through the file directory on the left side of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with Jupyter Notebooks, it's important to know the following: You can execute a given 'cell' in any notebook by placing your cursor in the cell and pressing the 'play' icon, or simply press shift+enter together. Some cells will take longer to run, and you will see a [$\\ast$] to the left of the cell while AE is still working.\n",

    "### About the AE Jupyer Hub\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Each notebook is flexibly designed so that users can follow existing analyses informed by best practices in climate science and build on or modify these analyses to meet their own specific needs. However, due to the configurations of the AE Jupyter Hub and the fact that this project is in active development, the Jupyter Notebooks will automatically update to reflect our team's latest code updates. To ensure that any changes you make are preserved, we suggest creating a copy of the file if you want to change and modifying that file instead. These copies of notebooks will persist in your personal file directory between sessions. "
