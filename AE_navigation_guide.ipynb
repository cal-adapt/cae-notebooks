    "### About Jupyter Notebooks \n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "If you are new to working with Jupyter Notebooks, check out our <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEo9V_OJw9w)</span> or review Jupyter's <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[introductory documentation](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb)</span>. You can also review our <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[technical documentation](https://climakitae.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</span> to learn more about the open source python library that powers these notebooks, `climakitae`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each link in the Table of Contents below will open up a Jupyter notebook that will step through: \n",
    "1) Selecting climate data you are interested in\n",
    "2) Transforming the data or conducting an analysis\n",
    "3) Exporting data or visualizations<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access these notebooks through the file directory on the left side of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working in a Jupyter Notebook, you can execute the code a given 'cell' in any notebook by placing your cursor in the cell and pressing the 'play' icon, or by simply pressing shift+enter together. Some cells will run instantaneouly, but some can take longer to run; in the latter case, you will see a [$\\ast$] to the left of the cell while the code is running.\n",

    "### Modifying and developing notebooks in the Jupyer Hub\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Each notebook is flexibly designed so that users can follow existing analyses informed by best practices in climate science and build on or modify these analyses to meet their own specific needs. However, due to the configurations of the AE Jupyter Hub and the fact that this project is in active development, the Jupyter Notebooks will automatically update to reflect our team's latest code updates. To ensure that any changes you make are preserved, we suggest creating a copy of the file if you want to change and modifying that file instead. These copies of notebooks will persist in your personal file directory between sessions. "

    "### data-access\n",
    "AE catalog data can be accessed in **three different ways**, each with distinct benefits. The appropriate data access method will depend on your unique use case and workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[basic_data_access.ipynb](data-access/basic_data_access.ipynb)</span>: Overview to accessing, spatially and temporally subsetting, and exporting climate data from the AE data catalog using helper functions in `climakitae`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[interactive_data_access_and_viz.ipynb](data-access/interactive_data_access_and_viz.ipynb)</span>: Retrieve, subset, and visualize data options using a simple and intuitive interactive graphical user interface (GUI). This notebook leverages functionality from both `climakitae` and our visualizations library `climakitaegui`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[outside_AE_data_access.ipynb](data-access/intake_direct_data_download.ipynb)</span>: Access and export AE catalog data without using the helper functions from AE's python libraries. This notebook instead leverages the python library `intake` for interfacing with the data catalog. This method may be useful for users accessing the data outside of the Analytics Engine and who don't want to set up `climakitae` in their computational environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <span style=\"color:#0000FF\">[renewables_data_access](data-access/renewables_data_access.ipynb\n",
    ")</span>: Access and plot our derived renewables data products. This notebook leverages the Python library `intake` for interfacing with the renewables data catalog, which is separate from the larger AE catalog. Eventually, data access will be fully integrated into `climakitae`, but for now, this is the best way to access the renewables data.\n",
