Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine Notebooks
====================================

The cae-notebooks repository consists of Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step functionality to access, analyze, and visualize climate data availale on the Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine. Tools included in the notebooks provide examples for how to work with both the **historical and projection climate model data** on the platform, and demonstrate how to move from the climate variables provided through the Analytics Engine to **actionable information that can inform decision-making and evaluate risks**.

Notebooks are organized by similar-themed notebooks:<br>
- **Data access notebooks** highlight various ways of accessing California's Fifth Climate Assessment data
    - Including `interactive_data_and_viz.ipynb` and `renewables_data_access.ipynb`<br>
- **Analysis notebooks** investigate a climate data topic but have no specific tools associated with the notebooks
    - Including `warming_levels.ipynb`, `timeseries_transformations.ipynb`, and `threshold_exceedance.ipynb` <br>
- **Collaborative notebooks** were co-produced with industry partners for a specific application, and may be of interest to all users
    - Including `vulnerability_assessment.ipynb` and `degree_days.ipynb`<br>
- **In progress notebooks** are currently in development for a specific application, and may have frequent updates before they are moved to another folder
    - Including `typical_meteorological_year_methodology.ipynb`

New to the Analytics Engine? Try `interactive_data_access_and_viz.ipynb` for a step-through of the basic functionality.

The notebooks are designed to be used as-is or serve as a starting point to adapt to specific needs, workflows, and particular applications.
