The `cae-notebooks` repository consists of Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step 
functionality to access, analyze, and visualize climate data available on the [Cal-Adapt: Analytics Engine](https://analytics.cal-adapt.org/). Tools included in the notebooks provide examples for how to work with the **historical and projection climate model data** on the platform, and demonstrate how to move from the climate variables provided through the Analytics Engine to **actionable information that can inform decision-making and evaluate risks**.

These notebooks are designed to be used as-is or as a starting point for users to adapt to their specific needs, workflows, and applications. 

> [!WARNING]
> The `climakitae` package (a crucial dependency of almost all notebooks) is under active development. APIs may change between versions and notebooks in this repository may change accordingly.

Please refer to [climakitae](https://github.com/cal-adapt/climakitae) for installation instructions, documentation, and updates.

Looking for a specific type notebook?

Notebooks are organized by their theme:<br>
- **Data access notebooks** highlight various ways of accessing California's Fifth Climate Assessment data
    - Including `interactive_data_and_viz.ipynb` and `renewables_data_access.ipynb`<br>
- **Analysis notebooks** investigate a climate data topic but have no specific tools associated with the notebooks
    - Including `warming_levels.ipynb`, `timeseries_transformations.ipynb`, and `threshold_exceedance.ipynb` <br>
- **Collaborative notebooks** were co-produced with industry partners for a specific application, and may be of interest to all users
    - Including `vulnerability_assessment.ipynb` and `degree_days.ipynb`<br>
- **In progress notebooks** are currently in development for a specific application, and may have frequent updates before they are moved to another folder
    - Including `typical_meteorological_year_methodology.ipynb`
