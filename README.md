Cal-Adapt Analytics Engine Notebooks
====================================

You may preview the following Jupyter notebooks containing example code that demonstrate real world use cases of the Analytics Engine. The notebooks provide step-by-step functionality to access, analyze, and plot climate data available on the Analytics Engine.

Try 'getting_started.ipynb' for a step-through of the basic functionality.

The notebooks can be used as-is or serve as a starting point to adapt to specific needs, workflows, and particular applications. 

Tools included in the notebooks provide examples for how to work with both the historical and projection data on the platform, and demonstrate how to move from the climate variables provided through the Analytics Engine to actionable information that can inform decision-making and evaluate risks.

Example notebooks in the tools folder:
- timeseries_transformations.ipynb:
    Demonstrates pulling up a toolkit for examining and processing time-series data. Motivated by Hourly climate  use case (for future time periods), for inputs into production cost, energy load forecasting, and other models.
- threshold_basics.ipynb:
    Demonstrates some functionality for calculating extreme value statistics. Motivated by the 'threshold-based analytics' use case for asset-by-asset vulnerability assessments and updating design standards.
