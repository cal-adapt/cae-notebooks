    "## High-level details \n",
    "The AE data catalog has many different types of data. Our helper library `climakitae` attempts to make accessing and retrieving this data intuitive, as well as simplify climate and statistical analysis with the data down the line, by performing some data transformations as the data is retrieved.<br><br> To retrieve the data, you'll need to make some selections as to your climate variable, data resolution, location settings, and many other options. There are also several high-level options you'll need to set when selecting your data, detailed below: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data type: Gridded or Stations\n",
    "**Gridded**: Gridded (i.e. raster) climate data at various spatial resolutions.<br><br>\n",
    "**Stations**: Gridded (i.e. raster) climate data at unique grid cell(s) corresponding to the central coordinates of the selected weather station(s). \n",
    "- This data is bias-corrected (i.e localized) to the exact location of the weather station using the historical in-situ data from the weather station(s). \n",
    "- This data is currently only available for dynamically downscaled air temperature data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific approach: Time or Warming Level\n",
    "**Time**: Retrieve the data using a traditional time-based approach that allows you to select historical data, future projections, or both, along with a time-slice of interest. \n",
    "- “Historical Climate” includes data from 1980-2014 simulated from the same GCMs used to produce the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). It will be automatically appended to a SSP time series when both are selected. Because this historical data is obtained through simulations, it represents average weather during the historical period and is not meant to capture historical timeseries as they occurred.\n",
    "- “Historical Reconstruction” provides a reference downscaled [reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/focus/2020/fact-sheet-reanalysis) dataset based on atmospheric models fit to satellite and station observations, and as a result will reflect observed historical time-evolution of the weather.\n",
    "- Future projections are available for [greenhouse gas emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, or SSP)](https://climatescenarios.org/primer/socioeconomic-development) SSP 3-7.0 through 2100 with the dynamically-downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs).\n",
    "     - One GCM was additionally downscaled for two additional SSPs (SSP 5-8.5 and SSP 2-4.5)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warming Level**: Retrieve the data by future global warming levels, which will automatically retrieve all available model data for the historical+future period and then calculate the time window around which each simulation reaches the selected warming level.  \n",
    "- Because warming levels are defined based on amount of global mean temperature change, they can be used to compare possible outcomes across multiple scenarios or model simulations.\n",
    "- This approach includes all simulations that reach a specified amount of warming regardless of when they reach that level of warming, rather than the time-based approach, which will preliminarily subset a portion of simulations that follow a given SSP trajectory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Downscaling method: Dynamical, Statistical, or both\n",
    "**Dynamical**: [Dynamically downscaled](https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/alexhall/downscaling-cmip6) WRF data, produced at hourly intervals. If you select 'daily' or 'monthly' for 'Timescale', you will receive an average of the hourly data. The spatial resolution options, on the other hand, are each the output of a different simulation, nesting to higher resolution over smaller areas.<br><br>\n",
    "**Statistical**: [Hybrid-statistically downscaled](https://loca.ucsd.edu) LOCA2-Hybrid data, available at daily and monthly timescales. Multiple LOCA2-Hybrid simulations are available (100+) at a fine spatial resolution of 3km."

    "- `time_slice` - Applies a time slice to the requested dataset.\n",
    "- `warming_level` - Applies a global warming level approach (as separate from the default time based approach). Please see our guidance on the use of global warming levels.\n",
    "- `metric_calc` - applies metric calculations to your dataset such as min, max, mean, median, percentiles, and 1-in-X calculations. \n",
    "- `convert_units` - converts the units of your dataset.\n",
    "- `bias_adjust_model_to_station` - For working with gridded data bias adjusted to historical HADISD weather station data.\n",
    "- `export` - Exports your requested dataset to a range of file formats\n",
