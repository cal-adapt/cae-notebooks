    "Global Warming Levels (GWLs) are an approach for examining regional climate impacts relative to global temperature change. Because modern climate models tend to agree more about **what regional climate impact will look like at each increment of global warming** than about precisely **when that amount of global warming will occur**, using GWLs is a powerful method for combining estimates of future conditions across multiple models and reducing the uncertainty that typically comes from different model estimates of global warming (global climate sensitivity). The GWL approach is used in the <span style=\"color: blue\">[most recent report on global climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6)](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)</span>, and the tools in the Analytics Engine follow the methods from that report as closely as possible.\n",
