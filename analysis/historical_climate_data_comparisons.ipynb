    "# Understanding Historical Climate Data on the Analytics Engine\n",
    "This notebook is a walkthrough of how to utilize different kinds of historical climate data, including weather observations, reanalysis products, and model output available on the Analytics Engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Weather observations are inherently point locations, tied to a single station location, and represent the actual values of weather variables. Weather observations are highly localized weather information, and are limited by instrumentation constraints.\n",
    "* Reanalysis products are reconstructions of the historical weather observation period. Like a climate model, reanalysis products have a complete set of atmospheric and surface weather variables on a full spatial grid. Because reanalysis synthesizes many sources of observations and utilizes simulations to produce a continuous output,  it should closely resemble observation from weather station data but should not be expected to match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Climate models run over the historical period represent the *general conditions* during a time period, but *do not reproduce specific events from the historical record*. Each simulation from a climate model is a free-running simulation producing unique weather events and internal variability. This variability in individual climate model realizations is how we are able to determine the range of potential future realities. In the historical period, variability across each climate model realizaiton represents the range of possible conditions that could have occurred. \n",

Climate model data will not match the year-to-year historical record, but it can be very useful to compare model output to observations or reanalysis product to evaluate how well each model represents particular features of the climate.
