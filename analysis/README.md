Analysis Notebooks
==================

These notebooks cover fundamental climate science topics, tools for analyzing extreme weather events of importance, and applications of global warming levels to your workflows.

[historical_climate_data_comparisons.ipynb](historical_climate_data_comparisons.ipynb): Learn how to compare datasets across the historical period, using observations, reanalysis, and model output.  

*For example: How do I compare historical precipitation between a weather station and climate model?*

[internal_variability.ipynb](internal_variability.ipynb): Explore uncertainty within climate models due to internal variability in the climate system, using projected changes in extreme precipitation across different climate model simulations.  

*For example: When should I pool observations across different global climate models to study extreme events?*

[model_uncertainty.ipynb](model_uncertainty.ipynb): Explore uncertainty across climate models, using projected variations in air temperature trends across different climate model simulations.  

*For example: When is it appropriate to take a mean across different global climate models?*

[threshold_event_types.ipynb](threshold_event_types.ipynb): Define different types of extreme events and explore their likelihood of occurence using extreme value theory.  

*For example: What is the return period (expected frequency of occurence) of an extreme heat event in Sacramento County that reaches at least 100 degrees for 3 days in a row?*

[threshold_exceedance.ipynb](threshold_exceedance.ipynb): Perform calculations and explore visualizations of threshold exceedance events using an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). An extension of the topics introduced in threshold_basics.  

*For example: How will the frequency of an event where temperatures are above 110°F for at least 5 hours in LA County change between now and end of century?*

[timeseries_tranformations.ipynb](timeseries_transformations.ipynb): Explore data transformation and analysis options for working with climate timeseries data using a graphical user interface (GUI).  

*For example: How will the 90th percentile of daily temperature values change in mid-century compared to the historical baseline?*

[warming_levels.ipynb](warming_levels.ipynb): Explore the concept of Global Warming Levels, which can be used to compare possible climate outcomes across multiple scenarios or model simulations, with respect to extreme event planning.  

*For example: How will average maximum temperatures in the Bay Area change when the world reaches 2°C of global warming?*

[warming_levels_approach.ipynb](warming_levels_approach.ipynb): A comparison notebook that walks through the differences between a time-based approach and a Global Warming Levels approach.  

*For example: Which scientific approach is more appropriate for my use case?*
