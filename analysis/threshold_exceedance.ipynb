    "This notebook calculates exceedance events (time periods above or below a certain threshold) at different time scales using the `thresholds()` tool, using different criteria describing the extreme event severity and duration (for example, how many 3-day periods per year contain at least five hours of temperatures above 100 degrees F?). For any given location using hourly data, we can calculate and display how frequencies of extreme events will change under different global emissions scenarios and across model simulations. \n",

    "The exceedance calculator can then be used to measure the frequency of exceedance events based on four different parameters: threshold to capture events above or below (e.g. temperatures above 80 degF, temperatures below 30 degF), length of time of the event (e.g. temperatures above a threshold for three hours), whether to count frequency of events seasonally or annually, and duration of extreme event occurrences (for example, to measure multi-day heat events, set this to the number of days you want to consider a heat event). \n",

    "Once you select the parameters of the event of interest, the plot on the right will show how frequencies of the defined extreme event change through the year 2100 across different GCM simulations, and changes can be explored for each global emissions scenario using the dropdown menu below the plot. Smoothing can optionally be applied to the time series as well.\n",
