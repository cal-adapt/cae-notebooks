Collaborative Notebooks
=======================

This folder contains notebooks we have developed with industry partners.

## Demand Forecast Unit (DFU)

[degree_days.ipynb](https://github.com/cal-adapt/cae-notebooks/blob/re-org/collaborative/DFU/degree_days.ipynb): Perform calculations and explore visualizations of generated weather and climate information for an annual consumption model by producing heating and cooling degree days.  
*For example: How will the number of heating degree days above 70°F in Sacramento change by mid-century?*

[localization_methodology.ipynb](https://github.com/cal-adapt/cae-notebooks/blob/re-org/collaborative/DFU/localization_methodology.ipynb): Introduction to the localization method for examining climate projections at a location.  
*For example: How does localization of global climate models to a weather station work?*

[station_hourly_profiles.ipynb](https://github.com/cal-adapt/cae-notebooks/blob/re-org/collaborative/DFU/station_hourly_profiles.ipynb): Explore the process to produce hourly profiles of localized data.  
*For example: What does the median hourly profile of 8760s look like for Los Angeles?*

## Investor-Owned Utilities (IOU)

[heat_index.ipynb](https://github.com/cal-adapt/cae-notebooks/blob/re-org/collaborative/IOU/heat_index.ipynb): Generate historical and projected trends of Heat Index at a location.  
*For example: How many summer days will be above a heat index of 91°F in Fresno by mid-century?*

[vulnerability_assessment.ipynb](https://github.com/cal-adapt/cae-notebooks/blob/re-org/collaborative/IOU/vulnerability_assessment/vulnerability_assessment.ipynb): Generate data-informed answers for vulnerability assessments through a customizeable metric builder.  
*For example: How intense will a 1-in-10 year heatwave look like in a 2°C warmer world?*
