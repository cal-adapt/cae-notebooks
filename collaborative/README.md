Collaborative Notebooks
=======================

This folder contains notebooks we have developed with industry partners, with broad benefits and information relevant to all users. 

## Demand Forecast Unit (DFU)

[degree_days.ipynb](DFU/degree_days.ipynb): Perform calculations and explore visualizations of generated weather and climate information for an annual consumption model by producing heating and cooling degree days.  

*For example: How will the number of heating degree days above 70°F in Sacramento change by mid-century?*

[download_localized_stations.ipynb](DFU/download_localized_stations.ipynb): Download bias-corrected air temperature and dewpoint temperature model timeseries localized for any of 71 weather stations in the WECC.  

*For example: What is the bias-corrected summer temperature timeseries at a single station?*

[localization_methodology.ipynb](DFU/localization_methodology.ipynb): Introduction to the localization method for examining climate projections at a location.  

*For example: How does localization of global climate models to a weather station work?*

[station_data_access.ipynb](collaborative/DFU/station_data_access.ipynb): Demonstrates how to access historical meteorological station data for stations of interest in the WECC.  

*For example: What is the historical mean surface air temperature at Sacramento Executive Airport (KSAC)?*

[station_hourly_profiles.ipynb](DFU/station_hourly_profiles.ipynb): Explore the process to produce hourly profiles of localized data.  

*For example: What does the median hourly profile of 8760s look like for Los Angeles?*

## Investor-Owned Utilities (IOU)

[heat_index.ipynb](IOU/heat_index.ipynb): Generate historical and projected trends of Heat Index at a location.  

*For example: How many summer days will be above a heat index of 91°F in Fresno by mid-century?*

[vulnerability_assessment.ipynb](IOU/vulnerability_assessment/vulnerability_assessment.ipynb): Generate data-informed answers for vulnerability assessments through a customizeable metric builder.  

*For example: How intense will a 1-in-10 year heatwave look like in a 2°C warmer world?*
