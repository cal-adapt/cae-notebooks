    "The Heat Index is computed using the NOAA Heat Index equation ([click here to visit NOAA Heat Index page](https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml)). The source code for this calculation can be found in the climakitae tools module ([click here to see source code](https://github.com/cal-adapt/climakitae/blob/main/climakitae/tools/indices.py#L48)). The Heat Index is calculated on-the-fly whenever `get_data()` is run as demonstrated in this notebook.   \n",
