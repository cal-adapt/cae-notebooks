Details within the methodology below provide greater context per each of the "main" kinds of metric calculations, 
as well as how global warming level based approach works computationally.

Methodology
===========
1-in-X temperature events
-------------------------
Example: 1-in-10 year maximum temperature

Arguments:
    <br>**one_in_x**: The return period ("X") is determined by the "one_in_x" argument, where "x" is the desired return period, and is required user input. Options are numerical.
    <br>**metric_calc**: Max/min denotes whether the daily minimum or maximum is desired (daytime high vs. nighttime low), where "metric_calc" is a required user input. Options are "min" and "max".

Order of operations:
    <br>1. Data is passed to the `get_block_maxima` threshold tools function in climakitae, for each simulation, with the "metric_calc" (min/max) is passed to the "extremes_type" parameter. Data is grouped by 1 day increments to calculate the annual maximum series.
    <br>2. Annual maximum series is passed to the `get_return_value` thresholds tool function in climakitae, where the "one_in_x" argument is passed to the "return_period" parameter. 
    <br>3. Return periods per simulation are concatenanted back into a single data object.
    <br>4. Data is returned.

Note: 1-in-X events use the default behavior of `get_return_value` from climakitae, with the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. 


Likely seasonal events
----------------------
Example: likely summer night low temperature

Arguments:
    <br>**percentile**: Likelihood is determined by percentile, where the "percentile" argument is required user input. Options are 0-100. 
    <br>**season**: Season is denoted by meteorological seasons (starting on 1st of month), where "season" is required user input. Options are "winter", "summer", "all".
    Winter is December, January, February (DJF); Summer is June, July, August (JJA); All is January through February (all months).
    <br>**metric_calc**: Max/min denotes whether the daily minimum or maximum is desired (daytime high vs. nighttime low), where "metric_calc" is a required user input. Options are "min" and "max".

Order of operations:
    <br>1. In data retrieval process, data is subsetted based on season argument. 
    <br>2. Data is resampled to a daily timestep if it is not already at daily temporal resolution, with the "metric_calc" (min/max) argument determining how the data is reduced.
    <br>3. Percentile is calculated to determine likelihood of occurrence. 
    <br>4. Data is returned. 


High heat index events
-----------------------
Example: how many days per year does the Heat Index exceed 90°F

Arguments:
    <br>**metric_calc**: Max/min denotes whether the daily minimum or maximum is desired (daytime high vs. nighttime low), where "metric_calc" is a required user input. Options are "min" and "max".
    <br>**heat_idx_threshold**: Threshold for heat index exceedance, where "heat_idx_threshold" is a required user input. Options are numerical. 

Order of operations:
    <br>1. Data is resampled to a daily timestep, with the number of events exceeding the "heat_idx_threshold" argument against the "metric_calc" (min/max) argument determining how the data is reduced. 
    <br>2. Data is then resampled a second time to an annual timestep by summing the number of events per year. 
    <br>3. Data is returned. 

Note: Heat Index can only be calculated with dynamically-downscaled data (WRF) due to the required input variables of air temperature and relative humidity available at hourly timescales.


1-in-X precipitation events *in progress*
---------------------------
Example: 1-in-100 year, 24 hour precipitation

Arguments:
    <br>**one_in_x**: The return period ("X") is determined by the "one_in_x" argument, where "x" is the desired return period, and is required user input. Options are numerical.
    <br>**metric_calc** Max/min denotes whether the daily minimum or maximum is desired (daytime high vs. nighttime low), where "metric_calc" is a required user input. Options are "min" and "max".

Order of operations:


Warming Levels
---------------
Example: 2°C warming level

Arguments:
    <br>**approach**: Warming level approach is designated by the "approach" argument, and is required user input. Options are "time" for time-based approach, and "warming_level" for GWL approach.
    <br>**warming_level**: The desired global warming level is determined by the "warming_level" argument, and is required user input. Options are 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0.

Order of operations:
    <br>1. Warming levels data is retrieved via the `warming_levels` functionality in climakitae. 
    <br>2. Warming levels data is a 30-year window centered around the year that each individual simulation exceeds the designated warming level, based on the "warming_level" argument. The 30-year window is (center_year - 15 years, center_year, center_year + 14 years).
    <br>3. A synthetic "time" dimension is added back to the data object in order to calculate metrics (which typically need "time" as a dimension to resample). 
    <br>4. Data is passed to the requested metric.
