The p-value of the distribution fit to the data is provided during the calculation step and as an attribute in the final data object. For 1-in-X precipitation events, **we recommend the use of \"gev\" as the distribution** for the first distribution test. GEV allows for a continuous range of different shapes, and will reduce to either Gumbel, Weibull, or Generalized Pareto distributions under different conditions. GEV is typically a better fit than the 3 individaul distributions, and is a common distribution in hydrological applications. If the **p-value is less than 0.05**, this indicates that the **selected distribution is not a good fit for the data**, and we recommend choosing a different distribution and re-running the `cava_data` function. \n",
