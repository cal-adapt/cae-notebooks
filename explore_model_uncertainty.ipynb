    "1. The increase in temperature will be perceived differently across California. Some locations may have a smaller increase (for example, coastal regions in some models, but not all), while other locations will have a larger increase in temperature (for example, the Sierra Nevadas and northern California in some models, but not all). \n",
    "2. There is a substantial difference between each model in how temperatures are simulated at the year the warming level is reached. \n",

    "2. For a 3°C warming level, there is approximately 1 degree °C difference in the mean conditions, and a 2.2-3.7 degree °C difference between the minimum and maximum simulated conditions.

    "1. The range of plausible future climates can be substantial, with a model simulating a very different response than another.\n",
    "2. The multi-model mean captures the average conditions, but provides no information towards the range of plausible outcomes. \n",
    "3. In addition to an annual time series, the differences between models throughout your area of interest is critical for understanding the spatial impact(s) of a plausible climate future.\n",
    "4. The multi-model mean is a useful tool, but should be employed carefully when answering a question. The multi-model mean can only report the average conditions. For many questions, this is an inappopriate metric to solely rely on. \n",
